Website Skeleton

This is a minimal, portable static site scaffold.

Structure
- index.html: HTML5 boilerplate with header/nav, main, and footer
- css/style.css: Simple theme and defaults
- js/main.js: Tiny script wiring a demo button and current year
- assets/: Place images, icons, etc. (empty placeholder included)

Quick start
- Open index.html directly in your browser, or
- Serve locally for cleaner routing and dev tools:
  - Python 3: python -m http.server 8080 (then open http://localhost:8080/scripting/website/)
  - Node (npx): npx serve . (then open the printed URL)

Customize
- Change the site title in index.html
- Adjust colors in css/style.css
- Add your logic in js/main.js
